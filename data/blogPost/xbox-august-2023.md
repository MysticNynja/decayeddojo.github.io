Xbox Game Pass is a subscription service that gives you unlimited access to hundreds of games for a monthly fee. You can play games on your Xbox console, PC, or mobile device via cloud streaming. Every month, new games are added to the service, while some older ones are removed. In this blog post, we will tell you what are all the new game pass games coming to Xbox and PC in August 2023, as well as some other games that you might want to check out.

One of the most anticipated games of the month is Celeste, a platformer that won multiple awards and received universal acclaim from critics and players alike. Celeste is a game about climbing a mountain, but also about overcoming your personal struggles and finding yourself. The game has a beautiful pixel art style, a touching story, and a soundtrack that perfectly matches the mood and atmosphere. The game also has an assist mode that allows you to adjust the difficulty level to suit your preferences and skills. You can make the game easier by slowing down time, giving yourself infinite stamina or air dashes, or skipping chapters. Or you can make the game harder by activating variants such as low gravity, wind, or invisible spikes. Celeste is a game that can be enjoyed by anyone, regardless of their gaming experience or background. Celeste will be available on Xbox console, PC, and cloud from August 1.

Another game that you should definitely try is Everspace 2, a space shooter with RPG elements that is currently in early access. Everspace 2 is a sequel to the successful Everspace, but it expands on the original game in many ways. Instead of being a roguelike with randomly generated levels, Everspace 2 is an open-world game with a handcrafted galaxy full of secrets, dangers, and loot. You can explore different star systems, planets, asteroids, and space stations, each with their own unique environments and challenges. You can also customize your spaceship with different weapons, modules, and skins, and upgrade your skills and perks as you level up. The game also has a story mode that follows the adventures of Adam Roslin, a former clone pilot who is trying to find his place in the galaxy after the events of the first game. The story mode is not finished yet, but it already offers several hours of gameplay and voice-acted cutscenes. The developers are constantly updating the game with new content and features, based on the feedback from the community. Everspace 2 is a game that will keep you hooked for hours with its addictive gameplay and stunning visuals. Everspace 2 will be available on PC from August 15.

If you are looking for some horror, you might want to check out The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, a survival horror game based on the iconic movie franchise. The game is set in 1974, and it lets you play as either one of the four friends who stumble upon a family of cannibals in rural Texas, or as Leatherface himself, who hunts them down with his chainsaw. The game features realistic graphics powered by Unreal Engine 4, stealth mechanics that allow you to hide from or distract your enemies, and online multiplayer that supports up to five players in co-op or versus modes. The game also has different endings depending on your choices and actions throughout the game. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a game that will make you feel the terror and suspense of the original movies. The Texas Chain Saw Massacre will be available on Xbox console and PC from August 18.

Finally, if you are looking for some retro-inspired fun, you might want to try Sea of Stars, a turn-based RPG that pays homage to the classics of the genre such as Chrono Trigger or Final Fantasy VI. Sea of Stars is set in the same universe as The Messenger, another indie hit from Sabotage Studio, but it takes place thousands of years before it. You can control six characters with different abilities and personalities, who embark on a quest to save the world from an evil force known as The Fleshmancer. The game features gorgeous pixel art that blends 2D and 3D elements, dynamic battles that use environmental factors and timing mechanics, environmental puzzles that require you to use your characters' skills creatively, and a charming story that mixes humor and drama. Sea of Stars is a game that will make you feel nostalgic for the golden age of RPGs while offering a fresh and modern take on them. Sea of Stars will be available on Xbox console and PC from August 29.
