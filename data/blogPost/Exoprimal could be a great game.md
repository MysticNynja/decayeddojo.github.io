# Exoprimal: A New Frontier for Dinosaur Action Games

If you are a fan of dinosaurs, exosuits, and online co-op action, you might want to check out Exoprimal, the latest game from Capcom that promises to deliver a thrilling and immersive experience. Exoprimal is an online, team-based action game that pits humanity's cutting-edge exosuit technology against history's most ferocious beasts – dinosaurs. Exosuits are grouped into different roles, such as assault, support, and defense, and players will pilot these exosuits to hold firm against overwhelming dinosaur swarms in online-only, team-based action game modes.

## What is the basic premise of Exoprimal?

Exoprimal is set in a near-future world where a mysterious phenomenon has caused dinosaurs to reappear all over the globe. Humanity has developed advanced exosuits to combat this threat, and has formed the Exoprimal Defense Force (EDF) to protect civilization from the prehistoric invaders. Players will join the EDF as exosuit pilots, and will team up with other players to take on various missions and challenges in different locations around the world. The game features a dynamic and responsive environment, where players can interact with objects, structures, and even the dinosaurs themselves. The game also boasts a realistic and detailed dinosaur AI system, where the creatures will behave according to their instincts, senses, and social behaviors.

## What are the different exosuit roles?

Exosuits are the main weapons and tools that players will use in Exoprimal. They are divided into four main roles: assault, support, defense, and specialist. Each role has its own strengths, weaknesses, abilities, and playstyles.

- Assault: These exosuits are designed for offensive combat, with high firepower and mobility. They can deal heavy damage to enemies with their weapons and skills, but they also have low defense and durability. Examples of assault exosuits are Deadeye, Barrage, and Murasame.
- Support: These exosuits are designed for team coordination and utility, with healing and buffing capabilities. They can heal and enhance their allies with their devices and abilities, but they also have low offense and range. Examples of support exosuits are Witchdoctor, Zephyr, and Nimbus.
- Defense: These exosuits are designed for defensive combat, with high armor and durability. They can withstand enemy attacks with their shields and skills, but they also have low speed and agility. Examples of defense exosuits are Roadblock, Paladin, and Vigilant.
- Specialist: These exosuits are designed for unique and specialized roles, with various abilities and functions. They can perform tasks that other exosuits cannot do with their gadgets and skills, but they also have specific weaknesses and limitations. Examples of specialist exosuits are Stealthy (stealth), Sniper (long-range), and Hacker (hacking).

Players can choose their preferred exosuit role according to their personal preference or team strategy. They can also customize their exosuits with different skins, weapons, items, and upgrades to suit their needs.

## What other people are saying
The game has received mixed reviews from critics and players, who praised its PvE content and combat mechanics, but criticized its PvP elements and lack of variety. Here are some snippets from different reviews:

> "Exoprimal has fantastic PvE content and an intriguing story, but its focus on competitive modes hurts its attractiveness to newcomers, and its lack of offline capabilities might eventually kill the game entirely. It has the potential to be so much more, but such a high-profile title shouldn't have to rely on potential alone."
> -- <cite>[Open Critic][1]</cite>


> "Exoprimal reveals its massive twist too late in the game. Capcom’s nostalgic romp through the halcyon days of hero shooters has pacing issues. [...] Unfortunately, in its slow-going opening hours, Exoprimal makes it frighteningly easy to write it off as another live-service hero shooter lurking in Overwatch’s shadow."
> -- <cite>[Polygon][2]</cite>

> "Exoprimal is a somewhat fun action shooter that can’t decide what it wants to be. What potential fun there is to be had in its awesome PvE boss fights and horde-mode missions are bogged down by tacked-on and unfun PvP-elements and locking gameplay content behind hours of story progression without informing the player beforehand."
> -- <cite>[Windows Central][3]</cite>

> "Exoprimal is a strong game that lacks the it-factor necessary to keep players coming back for the long-term. It has incredible combat and aesthetics that are a joy to engage with but that enjoyment only lasts so long when it takes a couple of hours to experience new game modes."
> -- <cite>[Screen Rant][4]</cite>

> "Mixed or average reviews based on 5 Critic Reviews [...] User Score 4.8 Generally unfavorable reviews based on 76 Ratings [...] Exoprimal is an online, team-based action game that pits humanity's cutting-edge exosuit technology against history's most ferocious beasts - dinosaurs."
> -- <cite>[Metacritic][5]</cite>

As you can see, Exoprimal is a game that has some great aspects, such as the exosuit classes, the dinosaur enemies, and the Leviathan AI, but also some major flaws, such as the unbalanced and intrusive PvP modes, the repetitive and formulaic gameplay loop, and the locked content behind story progression. If you are looking for a fun and mindless co-op shooter with dinosaurs, you might enjoy Exoprimal, but if you are looking for a deep and varied multiplayer experience with meaningful progression and customization, you might want to look elsewhere.

## What I think of the game 
This game was really fun at first, but once you get into the main game loop it loses the fun with repetition and this weird sence of being stuck in a redundant loop.  I have read though that this is the intention of the developers. To make you feel trapped in this loop.  Eventually you break out via a 'Firware Update' and it gets better, or so I've been told.  I still haven't gotten to that point so I don't know if it is true and makes the game expenentially better or if it just adds more of the same thing. Once we find out we'll post that video to our site as well as our social channels.

## How is the development process and support for Exoprimal?

Exoprimal is developed by Capcom, the renowned Japanese video game company behind popular franchises such as Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, Street Fighter, and Devil May Cry. The game is powered by the RE Engine, Capcom's proprietary game engine that has been used for many of their recent titles. The game is designed to be a cross-platform title, meaning that it will be available for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The game will also support cross-play and cross-progression features, allowing players to play with and switch between different platforms seamlessly.

Capcom has announced that Exoprimal will be a full-price game ($59.99 USD), and not a free-to-play or live service game. However, the game will have a seasonal content update system called the Survival Pass, which will offer players new exosuits, skins, weapons, items, missions, maps, modes, and more. The Survival Pass will have two tiers: a free tier that anyone can access by playing the game, and a premium tier that can be purchased for $9.99 USD per season. The premium tier will offer more rewards and exclusive items for players who want to enhance their gameplay experience.

Capcom has also stated that they will provide continuous support and updates for Exoprimal after its launch, based on player feedback and suggestions. They have already revealed some of their plans for future content updates, such as new dinosaur types (including flying and aquatic ones), new exosuit roles (such as stealth and sniper), new collaboration events (such as with Street Fighter 6), and more.

## What can we expect in the future from Exoprimal?

Exoprimal launched on July 13th, 2023 worldwide. The game is currently available on various platforms and retailers, and players who pre-ordered the game received some exclusive bonuses such as exosuit skins and early unlock tickets for certain exosuits. The game also has a deluxe edition that includes the first season of the Survival Pass premium tier and a head start kit that contains useful items for beginners.

Exoprimal is expected to be one of the most exciting and innovative games of 2023, offering players a unique and exhilarating way to experience dinosaur action. With its stunning graphics, realistic physics, diverse gameplay options, cross-platform features, and constant content updates, Exoprimal is a game that dinosaur fans and action lovers should not miss.
