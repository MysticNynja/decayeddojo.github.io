We are both trying to do something beter for ourselves, and we get to play games. So win, win."},{title:"Is this content explicit?",text:"Hell Fucking Yeah! Look if we had a president that can tell someone we can grab women by the pussy, I can say fuck every once and a while.  But to be fair the games and content we talk about is more mature anyway, so yes we act like the games.  Just no murder."},{title:"When can we expect more content?",text:"At first it will be sporatic, so follow us on social stuff if you really are in to it.  At some point we will make a calendar and stick to a schedule.  For right now we are getting our feet wet and will see what works for us since we both work Full Time opposite schedules."},{title:"Can we expect pro skills on the games you play?",text:"Absolutely not.  We are here to have fun, tell jokes, laugh, and have a good time.

Where is the passion for just playing games and entertaining?",text:"Look, if I was going to say I didn't care about the money I would be lying.  The point of this is to get to a point where it becomes a source of income.  I do care about entertaining, but the fact that this makes money is definitely a motivator. Now that being said we can't be bought so anything I say on this platform is my opinion."},{title:"For whatever reason I'd like to work with you guys.",text:"Wow.... Ok, never thought you'd get this far.  Just send us an email at:",email:!0},{title:"How is the best way to support you?",text:"For now its just watching, subscribing, and all that good jazz.  Later we will have all the things like subs, tips, maybe a patreon.  The thing I want to start is a store, but just not copy/paste shirts.  When that gets up and going, that would be the best way to support us."}],visible:null}}},l=o(8),component=Object(l.a)(n,(function(){var e=this,t=e._self._c;return t("div",{staticClass:"container overflow-hidden"},[t("ul",e._l(e.paginatedOrders,(function(o,n){return t("li",{key:n,staticClass:"text-white cursor-pointer border-2 border-secondary-80 py-7 px-8 md:px-12 rounded-xl mb-7 text-lg md:text-2xl font-bold uppercase",on:{click:function(t){e.visible=n}}},[e._v("\n            "+e._s(o.title)+"\n            "),t("div",{directives:[{name:"show",rawName:"v-show",value:e.visible===n,expression:"visible===index"}],staticClass:"cursor-text text-base capitalize text-gray-300 font-normal leading-8 mt-5"},[t("p",[e._v(e._s(o.text)+" ")]),o.email?t("h3",[t("a",{attrs:{href:"mailto:work@decayeddojo.com"}},[e._v("work@decayeddojo.com")])]):e._e(),t("p")])])})),0)])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=component.exports}}]);
