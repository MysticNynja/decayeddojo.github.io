# Test Results and Task Log

This file tracks tasks, testing protocol, and results.

- Initial state: Repo contained a Nuxt 2 static site (docs built output), not the described React/FastAPI template. No backend present.
- User decision: Build a new React+TypeScript app with Tailwind and TinaCMS (git-based local Markdown). Use placeholder links for streams/store for now. Streamer names: SxySamurai, MysticNynja, DecayedDojo. Discord: https://discord.gg/raZgP24FUN

Testing Protocol:
- Backend: No backend in scope currently. Skip backend tests.
- Frontend: Manual smoke tests by E1 and optional auto testing agent upon user confirmation.
- Update this file after major changes.
