                <p>The core team of Decayed Dojo have known each other for about 2 decades, and in those decades we have played everything from Superman 64 to Diablo 4.  We decided to take the plunge into digital content creation.</p>
                <p>We really want to entertain, hang out more, and if we make some new friends along the way that would be great! This is our digital home and hopefully you can find something here that makes you entertained.  If not, glad you gave us a shot! </p>
